I made this base on [a peerjs tutorial](https://www.sitepoint.com/file-sharing-component-react/) by [Wern Ancheta](https://github.com/anchetaWern)

This web uses [peerjs](http://peerjs.com/) as connecting library, [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) as signaling server (still developing), and some [atlaskit components](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/). It also uses [an component that I contributing to atlaskit](https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit/pull-requests/2945) which can be found in [my bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/thienbui97/atlaskit/src/64bb27c21f0eb6ebc081d6f6249f9a28f85cd7d3/packages/text-area/?at=master).
